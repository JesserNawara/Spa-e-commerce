# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1- npm run server ( starts the json-server with the mock data available in data/db.json).

2- npm run start (you will be asked to use a different port type y (yes) )

## Extra Notes

This project was my first time using json-server so i assumed it is basically focused on front end and UI/UX design, therefore my main goals/challenges in the project were:

- Creating well organised , user friendly , color appealing design.
- Using different animation and CSS tools to improve user ecperience.
- Using multiple components with consideration to separating concerns to ensure good performance and keep clean code.
- Each component will have his own css file with easy clear naming and tags.
